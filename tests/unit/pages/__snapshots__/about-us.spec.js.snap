              Our goal is to work with Colombian companies exhibiting a high
              potential for social impact in order to strengthen their
              management and growth through professional training and
              guidance. These companies work with a network of successful
              business professionals from around the country, as well as
              senior management representatives from the Bolívar Business
              Group, who share their knowledge in order to build
              entrepreneurial initiatives.

              Over 100 musicians form this exemplary orchestra, which has been
              recognized for its talent and world-class performances through
              its array of professional shows on different musical stages
              around the world.
            
            </p>
             
            <p>
              
              Created in 2010, the Filarmónica Joven de Colombia has launched
              the musical careers of more than 400 young musicians who have
              achieved their dreams of showcasing their talent by being part
              of one of the best symphonic youth orchestras. The pride that
              their country has for this orchestra motivates these young
              musicians to continue forward with their careers.
            
            </p>
             
            <p>
              
              The Filarmónica Joven de Colombia partners with multiple
              national and international institutes. Thanks to its partnership
              with the YOA (Orchestra of America), the orchestra maintains a
              strong bond with teachers from the University of Minnesota, the
              University of Kansas, Ball State University, the Minnesota
              Orchestra, and the New York Metropolitan Orchestra. Since 2014,
              the orchestra has developed important relationships with the
              Houston Symphony Orchestra, the Mahler Chamber Orchestra, the
              Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra, and the Escuela Superior de
              Música Reina Sofía in Madrid (with whom the orchestra
              participates in an exchange program agreement).

              offers playful learning spaces where beneficiaries are able to

              in a holistic manner with their environment. This way we rewrite
              history, not only of children and adolescents, but also of their
              communities.

              Many students have completed their studies thanks to our Becas
              (scholarships) program. We are proud to be part of the
              educational formation of so many students who will become
              skilled professionals prepared to create positive change
              and transform the face of Colombia.
